### Easy to use, Easier to contributeâš“

## Description ðŸš€
This is <b>Curve Distribution</b> is open-sourced python packageðŸ’¥ read in data from a txt file. The txt file should have
one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored and according there are several functions are present:
- Gaussian Distribution ðŸ‘¾
- Binomial Distribution ðŸ‘½<br> 
functions includes calculating mean,standard deviation,plotting in-from of histograms,getting
probability distribution function,plotting the normalized histogram of the data and a plot of 
the probability density function along the same range,etc.
