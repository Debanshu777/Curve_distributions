Description: # Curve_distributions
        
        ## Description 
        This is Curve Distribution package read in data from a txt file. The txt file should have
        one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored and according there are several functions 
        are present:
        - Gaussian Distribution
        - Binomial Distribution <br>
        functions includes calculating mean,standard deviation,plotting in-from of histograms,getting
        probability distribution function,plotting the normalized histogram of the data and a plot of 
        the probability density function along the same range,etc.
         
        ## Classes
        - Gaussian distribution class for calculating and
            visualizing a Gaussian distribution.
        
            Attributes:
            
                - mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
                - stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
                - data_list (list of floats) a list of floats extracted from the data file
        - Binomial distribution class for calculating and 
            visualizing a Binomial distribution.
            
            Attributes:
            
                - mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
                - stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
                - data_list (list of floats) a list of floats to be extracted from the data file
                - p (float) representing the probability of an event occurring
                - n (int) number of trials
        
        
        ## Functions
